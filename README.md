### Springside Chestnut Hill Academy Senior Project

IOS application in Swift

Provides gymnasts with a platform to track their competition scores and placements. Users are able to add details about their competition and their scores for each of the four events: vault, bars, beam, and floor. The application is built using MongoDB Realm Mobile Database and MongoDB Atlas cloud device sync allowing users to add and update their data wherever and whenever they want.
